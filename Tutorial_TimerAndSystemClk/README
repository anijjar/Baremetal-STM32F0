- Run "st-util" on power shell if using GDB
- clean up the directory with "make clean"
- compile and assemble files using "make"
- launch GDB using "make gdb"
- Type "target extended-remote :4242" in GDB (4242 is from st-util)
- Type "run" to start code
- See commands below

This will only work on the stm32f0308-Discovery board. The linker and core files need to be rewritten otherwise.

## Commands for GDB:
- continue ~ runs the program until it encounters breakpoint
- step ~ walk line by line in the program
- load ~ upload code to stm
- run ~ run the program
- kill ~ kill the program
- /x ~ print contents of an address
- print <var_name> ~ gets variable value
- ptype <var_name> ~ gets variable type (does not work for uints)
- whatis <var_name> ~ gets variable type (works for uints)
- explore  <var_name> ~ gets variable type (works for uints)
- br <line of code to stop at>
- Bt ~ prints summary of how the program got to where it is. 

# STM Clock
Using the PLL, we can raise the 8MHz clock into 48MHz. This increases current consumption.

Using an external Clock would increase accuracy. 
PLL takes time to stabalize.
