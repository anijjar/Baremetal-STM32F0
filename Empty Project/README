to use this project

- [] Run st-util on a command prompt
- [] on a new cmd pmt, run 'make dbg' to launch the gdb debugger
- [] enter 'target extended-remote :<port from st-util ( usually 4242)>
- [] run 'load' in gdb to upload code onto microcontroller 

This will only work on the stm32f0308-Discovery board. The linker and core files need to be rewritten otherwise.

Commands for GDB:
- [] print <var_name> ~ gets variable value
- [] ptype <var_name> ~ gets variable type (does not work for uints)
- [] whatis <var_name> ~ gets variable type (works for uints)
- [] explore  <var_name> ~ gets variable type (works for uints)
