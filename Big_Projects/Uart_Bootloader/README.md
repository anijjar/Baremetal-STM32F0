# UART Bootloader

Using UART, we can flash the micro during runtime - either remotly or locally. This will be useful for me when I deploy the door monitor to my store. Things to look for will be encryption, signing, and locking for security purposes.

For learning purposes, I will do both a C  and assm implementation. C is more practical, but assm would be good for performance improvements.
