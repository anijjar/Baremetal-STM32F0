Empty directory for this project. Cant start it due to lacking funds to buy power supply.

Goal is to make a simple AUV by first using a pi, then moving onto a microcontroller.
AUVs are stupid expensive; requiring quotes to obtain most of the time. This one will
be open for people to buy for cheap. Ideally under 100 bucks. With my skills, I should
be able to do it.
