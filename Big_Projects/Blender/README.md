Empty directory for this project. Will not start due to lacking funds to buy hardware.

Blenders are a usefull tool in commericial business and home use. Surprisingly,
they are not hard to build. A 20$ build in bulk is priced upwards to 1000s of dollars. 
Most commercial blenders use brushed dc motors, which are annoying to repair due to the brushes
being hard to obtain. The goal here is to build a simple prototype and see how well it performs
against mainstream products such as vitamix. Who knows, maybe I can get someone to buy it lol.
